## About

Quality assurance dashboard for display on the production floor. UI is simple and designed using JavaScript and HTML. The dashboard runs on a local machine in the server room. The dashboard is displayed using a Raspberry Pi connected to the local network. 

Quality control specialist enters data from inspections. The following data is entered on a weekly basis for each shift: number of inspections, number of inspections out of compliance â€“ the percentage out of compliance is generated and the average out of compliance for the last for weeks is calculated. A Chart shows the week at a glance displaying the percentage out of compliance per shift and color coded. Green meaning good, orange meaning needs improvement, red means needs significant improvement.
